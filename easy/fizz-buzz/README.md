# Fizz Buzz
Fizz Buzz is a game usually played by children in which two players take turns yelling a number, "fizz", "buzz", or "fizzbuzz". The most common rules of the game are that numbers divisible by 3 are replaced by "fizz" and that those divisible by 5 are replaced by "buzz." Multiples of both are replaced by "fizzbuzz." The game is usually played until one player makes a mistake and says the wrong thing.

Write a program that takes as input `n` and prints the answers to FizzBuzz from 1 to `n`.
