# Minimum Lexicographic
Given a string, remove a single character from the string such that after the removal of this one specific character, the string's lexicographic value is minimized. The lexicographic ordering is the dictionary order, so you want to move each string as close to the front of the dictionary as possible.

## Examples
`"apple"` ⇒ `"aple"`

`"beatrice"` ⇒ `"batrice"`

`"tree"` ⇒ `"ree"`
